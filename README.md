Hello, World
------------

The projects repository for __Sculpting Data into Everyday Objects__
is empty at the moment, but will soon be full of you and your classmates'
awesome work! Before that can happen, you'll need to be up and running
with GitHub.

### Step 1

If you don't already have one, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
It will give you the opportunity to collaborate with others for a long time
and grow a portfolio of your work. Be sure to use an email address you will
still have access to once you graduate.

### Step 2

Install `git` on your computer. The [Downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
page from the official site should get you going.

There is a page of [git clients](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
for most systems -- some free and some not -- in case you're not always
comfortable with typing raw commands into a terminal shell. _(Disclosure:
I have not tried any of these, because I like typing raw commands into
a terminal.)_

### Step 3

Test your set up by cloning _this_ repository. (See the __SSH clone URL__
in the right navigation bar of this page.)

Don't worry if you don't get through this last step on your own.
We'll make sure that everyone is on the same page during the Python workshop
class on February 12th.

### Questions?

You can reach me via the public email address on
[my GitHub profile](http://github.com/drjerry/).
Please add "[sculpting data]" to the subject line to help me stay on top
of things.
